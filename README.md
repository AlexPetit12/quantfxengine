quantfxengine is a project of mine for quantitative forex trading at [OANDA](http://www.oanda.com).

It is based on code from [quantstart](http://www.quantstart.com/articles/Forex-Trading-Diary-1-Automated-Forex-Trading-with-the-OANDA-API).

CAUTION: ALGORITHMIC TRADING IS A WAY TO LOSE LOTS OF MONEY VERY FAST. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW; WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DO NOT TRADE ON LIVE ACCOUNTS. Practice accounts are okay.

You can start this stuff with `python trading/trading.py`

Also you probably want to have a look at settings.py.
If you want to trade with OANDA with this programm, you need to have
your account id in the environment variable OANDA_API_ACCOUNT_ID and
your access token in OANDA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN

Backtesting is also possible if you have a suitable csv-file.
